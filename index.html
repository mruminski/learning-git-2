					<p>Where were you in sixty-eight
					In sixty-eight Julie was Johnnie's date
					Two kids growin' together
					Livin' each day as if time was slippin' away
					Oh, they were just sixteen
					And their love a teenage dream
					They passed the time, they crossed the line
					The line that ran between
					Julie and Johnnie now you've made it</p>
