					<p>Where were you in sixty-eight
					In sixty-eight Julie was Johnnie's date
					Two kids growin' together
					Livin' each day as if time was slippin' away
					Oh, they were just sixteen
					And their love a teenage dream
					They passed the time, they crossed the line
					The line that ran between
					Julie and Johnnie now you've made it</p>
					<p>Suzie and Davey got to make the big time
					Maybe they can put it all together
					In a show that lasts forever
					Oh they would walk the strip at nights
					And dream they saw their name in lights
					On Desolation boulevard
					They'll light the faded light
					Suzie and Davey you can make it</p>
					<p>So where were you in sixty-eight
					When Bobby and Billy thought
					That sixty eight was out of date
					They took the flowers from their hair
					And tried to make us all aware
					Too bad, too late
					So they lived from day to day
					And tried to do it all their way
					But sixty-eight was sixty-eight
					No matter what they say
					Bobby and Billy maybe you'll make it one day...</p>
